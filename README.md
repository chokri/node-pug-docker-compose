[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/chokri/node-pug-docker-compose.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is my starter kit to start using a Node JS (Express Pug Project) with Docker-compose.

## Install

You must install Docker on your machine first!

Just run `docker-compose up --build`

If you have a new recommendations all pull requests are welcome !
